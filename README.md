# JS / TS Seed project

This is a small little seed project to develop Vanilla JS or TS applications without no library but only lit-html

## Install

The only thing you have to do is run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

> This command makes the installation of all project dependencies.

### Scripts

Here we have all application scripts:

*TODO: Pending to write testing phase*

```bash
$ npm start
```

> With only this command we are able to see the application running in http://localhost:1234/

```bash
$ npm run build
```

> Take the project and make a built product ready to be delivered at _dist_ folder.

```bash
$ npm test
```

> If you want to test the project integrity and coverage


### Notes

- If you want to use only javascript and remove all typescript stuff you only have to remove typescript dependency from _package.json_ file.
